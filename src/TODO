        - check set.has(clicked id)
            - if yes
                - check if high score > curr score
                    - if yes: set high score to curr score (prob convert num to str)
                - reset curr score and set to 0 and empty
            - if no: add id to set
            - bonus (if score == max, change to '32(max)' )
